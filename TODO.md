# TODO

GOAL: Ideally we have Pixel, A1, Clive, and one Denizen all published on the same day.
create a new script that generates all articles for all reporters on the same day [??? optional ???]
- [] Update [generate_articles_all_reporters.py](generate_articles_all_reporters.py)
- [] Add the ability for each reporter in reporters to have the same date
- [] currently app.py is set to add one a week, but we'd like all reporters to have the same date published
- [] add a --denizen generation for the same day.
- [] update app.py to allow for a manual date to be set for each reporter
