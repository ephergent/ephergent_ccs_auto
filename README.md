# Ephergent CCS Auto - Content Creation System

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `app.py` script, the main orchestrator for the Ephergent Content Creation System (CCS). It's designed to help junior Python developers understand its architecture, workflows, and how to interact with it.

## 1. Project Overview

The Ephergent CCS Auto project is an automated content creation pipeline. It's designed to generate various forms of digital content, including articles, images, audio narrations, and videos, based on given topics or pre-defined story structures. The system can then export this content for static site generators like Pelican, publish it to Git repositories, distribute it via social media, and send email notifications.

`app.py` is the central script that ties all these functionalities together.

## 2. Core Functionality of `app.py`

`app.py` serves as the main entry point and orchestrator for the entire content generation process. It handles:

*   **Command-line argument parsing:** To determine the desired workflow (e.g., generate new content, process input files, regenerate old content, generate denizen profiles, publish archived content, set article status).
*   **Configuration loading:** Reading settings from environment variables (via `.env` file, see `env-example`) and pre-defined constants.
*   **Workflow management:** Calling various utility modules (found in the `utils/` directory) in sequence to perform specific tasks like topic generation, article writing, image creation, audio/video generation, exporting, and publishing.
*   **Error handling and logging:** Providing feedback on the process via console and file logs (`ephergent_content_creator.log`) and managing failures gracefully.
*   **Resource management:** Setting up temporary directories for artifact generation during a run and cleaning them up based on configuration.

## 3. Key Features and Workflows in `app.py`

`app.py` supports several distinct operational modes, controlled by command-line arguments.

### 3.1. Automatic Content Generation (`--auto-generate`)

This is the primary mode for creating entirely new article content from scratch.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Reporter Selection:**
        *   If a `--reporter <reporter_id>` is specified, that reporter personality (defined in `prompts/personality_prompts.json`) is used.
        *   Otherwise, a random reporter is chosen using `Reporter.get_random_reporter()` from `utils/reporter.py`.
    2.  **Topic Generation:**
        *   If a `--topic "<topic_string>"` is specified, that topic is used.
        *   Otherwise, a new topic is generated by `utils/topic_generator.py` based on the selected reporter's profile and the Ephergent universe system prompt (`prompts/ephergent_universe_prompt.md`).
    3.  **Contextual Awareness (Vector DB Search):**
        *   The system, via the `Archiver` class (`utils/archiver.py`), searches its ChromaDB vector database for articles similar to the current topic. This provides context to the AI to avoid repetition and potentially inspire new angles. This step is skipped if the `archiver` is not initialized or if the `archive` step is skipped.
    4.  **Article Content Generation:**
        *   The core text of the article is generated by `utils/article.py` using the Gemini AI model. The prompt includes the system prompt, reporter's persona, topic, and context from similar articles.
    5.  **Summary Generation:**
        *   A concise summary of the article is created by `utils/summarize.py`, also using the Gemini AI model and the reporter's voice.
    6.  **Title Generation:**
        *   Multiple potential titles are generated by `utils/title.py` (Gemini AI), and the first one is typically selected.
    7.  **Artifact Orchestration (`orchestrate_artifact_generation` function):** This central function handles the creation of all media and textual outputs.
        *   **Image Generation:**
            *   A "feature image" is generated by `utils/image_generator.py` using `generate_ephergent_image`. The prompt for this is created by `generate_story_image_prompt`.
            *   A single "article essence image" is generated. The prompt for this is created by `generate_article_essence_image_prompt` and then the image by `generate_ephergent_image`.
            *   Both use ComfyUI (configured via `COMFYUI_URL`) and a specific workflow (e.g., `text_to_image_2lora_FLUX.json`).
            *   Image prompts are saved to a JSON file (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-slug_image_prompts.json`) in the run's output directory.
        *   **Audio Generation:**
            *   The article content is converted to speech by `utils/audio_generator.py` using a Text-To-Speech (TTS) service (Kokoro TTS, configured via `KOKORO_URL`). The reporter's voice preference is used. Audio effects (fade-in/out) can be applied.
        *   **Video Generation:**
            *   If audio and feature image are available, a simple video is created by `utils/video_generator.py` using MoviePy. It typically combines the feature image, article essence image (if available), and audio.
        *   **YouTube Upload:**
            *   The generated video can be uploaded to YouTube by `utils/youtube_uploader.py`, including title, description, tags, and thumbnail. Requires Google API credentials.
        *   **Pelican Formatting:**
            *   The article content and metadata are formatted into a Markdown file suitable for the Pelican static site generator by `utils/pelican_exporter.py` using `format_story_markdown`. This includes links to images, audio, and the YouTube video.
        *   **Pelican Export:**
            *   The Markdown file and associated media (images, audio) are copied to the Pelican content directory (configured by `PELICAN_CONTENT_DIR`) by `utils/pelican_exporter.py`.
        *   **Git Publishing:**
            *   Changes to the Pelican content directory are committed and pushed to a Git repository by `utils/git_publisher.py`. Requires `PELICAN_PROJECT_DIR` and `PUSH_TO_GIT=true`.
        *   **Archiving:**
            *   All generated artifacts (Markdown, images, audio, video, summary, prompts JSON) are saved to a structured archive directory (`archive/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/`) by `utils/archiver.py`. The article content and metadata are also added to the ChromaDB vector database here for future contextual awareness.
        *   **Email Notification:**
            *   An email notification about the new article can be sent via Mailgun by `utils/mailgun_sender.py`. Requires Mailgun API credentials and configuration.
        *   **Social Media Posting:**
            *   The new article (title, summary, link, feature image) can be posted to social media platforms like Bluesky and Farcaster (Warpcast) by `utils/social_publisher.py`. Requires platform credentials and `POST_TO_SOCIAL=true`.
*   **Skipping Steps:** The `SKIP_STEPS` environment variable or the `--skip` command-line argument can be used to bypass certain parts of this workflow (e.g., `skip_steps=video,social`).

### 3.2. Processing Stories from Input Files (Default mode if no other major flag is set)

This mode processes pre-defined story structures from JSON files.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Input Directory:** Reads `*.json` files from the `input/stories/ready/` directory.
    2.  **File Naming Convention:** Expects files like `MMM_WW.json` (e.g., `001_01.json` for Month 1, Week 1) to determine a scheduled publish date relative to `SEASON_START_DATE`.
    3.  **Data Extraction:** Parses JSON for story `title`, `content`, `summary`, `Filed by` (reporter), `Month`, `Week`, `location`, `stardate`, and `featured_characters`.
    4.  **Reporter Identification:** Maps the "Filed by" string to a known reporter ID using `get_reporter_from_name`.
    5.  **Publish Date Calculation:** Determines the target publish date using `calculate_publish_date`.
    6.  **Artifact Orchestration:** Calls the same `orchestrate_artifact_generation` function as the auto-generate workflow, but uses the content, title, summary, and other metadata from the JSON file instead of generating them.
    7.  **File Archiving:** After successful processing and archiving of artifacts, the input JSON file is moved from `input/stories/ready/` to `input/stories/archived/`.
*   **Limiting:** The `--limit N` argument can restrict processing to the first N story files found.

### 3.3. Dimensional Denizen Generation (`--denizen`)

This workflow is specialized for creating "Dimensional Denizen" profiles, which are character-focused pieces.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Profile Generation:** Calls `utils.profile_image_generator.generate_denizen_profile()`. This utility:
        *   Generates random character details (appearance, type, gender, etc.).
        *   Generates a character name and backstory using Gemini AI.
        *   Generates a "profile image" (feature image) and an "action image" (article image) for the denizen using ComfyUI via `utils/image_generator.generate_image_with_comfyui`. Prompts are constructed by `utils/profile_image_generator.py`.
        *   Saves these images and returns the denizen's data (name, backstory, details, image paths, filename base).
    2.  **Artifact Generation (similar to other workflows but tailored for denizens):**
        *   **Reporter:** Uses "Pixel Paradox" as the default reporter for Denizen profiles.
        *   **Audio:** Generates audio for the denizen's profile using `utils/audio_generator.prepare_denizen_text_for_tts` and `generate_article_audio`.
        *   **Video:** Creates a video profile using `utils/video_generator.generate_youtube_video`.
        *   **YouTube Upload:** Uploads the denizen video.
        *   **Pelican Formatting:** Uses `utils/pelican_exporter.format_denizen_pelican_markdown` for a specific denizen layout.
        *   **Export, Git, Archive, Email, Social:** Similar to the standard article workflow but uses denizen-specific paths, categories ("Dimensional Denizen"), and title format ("Daily Dimensional Denizen: {char_name}").
*   **Dependencies:** This mode relies heavily on `utils/profile_image_generator.py` and its associated image and text generation capabilities.

### 3.4. Artifact Regeneration (`--regenerate ARCHIVE_ID --steps STEPS_LIST`)

This mode allows re-creating specific artifacts or re-triggering publishing steps for an already existing and archived piece of content.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Identify Archive:** Takes an `ARCHIVE_ID` (which is the directory name in the `archive/` directory, e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-slug`).
    2.  **Specify Steps:** Requires a comma-separated list of `STEPS` to regenerate or re-trigger (e.g., `image`, `audio`, `youtube`, `social`). Valid steps are defined in `VALID_REGEN_STEPS`: `image`, `feature_image`, `article_image`, `audio`, `video`, `youtube`, `mail`, `social`.
    3.  **Load Data:**
        *   Reads the archived Markdown file (`<ARCHIVE_ID>.md`) from the archive to extract metadata (title, author, category, tags, YouTube URL) and original content body using `utils/metadata_utils.extract_pelican_metadata`.
        *   Locates existing artifacts (images, audio, video, prompts JSON) in the archive.
    4.  **Execute Selected Steps:**
        *   If `image`, `feature_image`, or `article_image` is specified, the relevant images are regenerated using `utils/image_generator.generate_ephergent_image`. New prompts are generated (or existing ones from `image_prompts.json` can be reused/updated if images are not being regenerated). The `image_prompts.json` file in the archive is updated.
        *   If `audio` is specified, new audio is generated from the original content body using `utils/audio_generator.generate_article_audio`.
        *   If `video` is specified, a new video is created by `utils/video_generator.generate_youtube_video`, using newly regenerated audio/images if available, otherwise falling back to existing archived versions.
        *   If `youtube` is specified, the video (new or existing) is re-uploaded to YouTube by `utils/youtube_uploader.upload_to_youtube`. The YouTube URL in the Pelican Markdown metadata *and* the HTML embed code in the content body are updated.
        *   If `mail` is specified, an email notification is re-sent using the article's existing data.
        *   If `social` is specified, social media posts are re-triggered using the article's existing data.
    5.  **Update Archive & Pelican:**
        *   Newly generated artifacts replace their counterparts in the main archive directory (`archive/<ARCHIVE_ID>/`).
        *   The corresponding files in the Pelican content directory (`PELICAN_CONTENT_DIR`) are also updated (including the Markdown if the YouTube URL/embed changed).
    6.  **Commit Changes:** If Pelican content was updated, changes are committed to Git using `utils/git_publisher.publish_to_git`.
*   **Temporary Directory:** Regeneration uses a temporary output directory (e.g., `output/regen_<archive_id>_<timestamp>/`), which is cleaned up afterward if `CLEANUP_ARTIFACTS` is true.

### 3.5. Publish Archived Article (`--publish-archive ARCHIVE_ID`)

This mode copies an already archived article and its associated media files from the `archive/` directory to the Pelican content directory and then commits these files to the Git repository. This is useful if an article was archived but not initially exported/published to Pelican.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Identify Archive:** Takes an `ARCHIVE_ID`.
    2.  **Locate Archived Files:** Finds the Markdown file and associated media (images, audio) within the specified archive directory.
    3.  **Copy to Pelican:** Copies these files to the appropriate subdirectories within the configured `PELICAN_CONTENT_DIR`.
    4.  **Commit Changes:** Commits the newly copied files to the Git repository managed by `PELICAN_PROJECT_DIR`.

### 3.6. Set Article Status (`--set-status ARCHIVE_ID --status {draft,published}`)

This mode allows you to change the `Status:` metadata field in the Pelican markdown file for a specific archived article and commit that change. This is typically used to mark an article as ready for publication or to revert it back to a draft state.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Identify Article:** Takes an `ARCHIVE_ID`.
    2.  **Specify Status:** Takes the desired `status` ('draft' or 'published').
    3.  **Locate Pelican Markdown:** Finds the corresponding markdown file in the Pelican content directory, checking both standard article and denizen subdirectories.
    4.  **Update Status:** Reads the markdown file, finds the `Status:` line (case-insensitive), updates its value, or adds the `Status:` line if it's missing, inserting it within the metadata block.
    5.  **Commit Changes:** Commits the modified markdown file to the Git repository managed by `PELICAN_PROJECT_DIR`.

### 3.7. Vector DB Memory Building (`--build-memory`)

*   **Purpose:** Intended to scan the entire archive directory, parse all Markdown files, and populate/update the ChromaDB vector database with their content. This allows the "Contextual Awareness" feature to find relevant past articles.
*   **Current Status:** The `app.py` script includes a placeholder for this functionality. The `Archiver` class (`utils/archiver.py`) automatically adds articles to the vector DB during the archiving step of normal content generation. The `--build-memory` flag currently logs a message that full rescan is not yet implemented in the `Archiver`.

## 4. Setup and Configuration

### 4.1. Environment Variables (`.env` file)

The application uses a `.env` file in the project root to manage configuration and secrets. Create this file by copying `env-example` and populating it with necessary values. Key variables include:

## 7. Code Structure of `app.py`

`app.py` is structured as follows:

*   **Shebang & Imports:** Standard Python script start and import statements for standard libraries, third-party packages, and local utility modules from `utils/`.
*   **Logger Setup:** Initializes the `logging` system to output messages to both `ephergent_content_creator.log` and the console.
*   **Configuration:** Defines global constants (e.g., `OUTPUT_DIR`, `INPUT_STORIES_DIR_READY`), loads environment variables using `dotenv`, and initializes global settings like `SKIP_STEPS` and `VALID_REGEN_STEPS`.
*   **Reporter Mapping (`REPORTER_NAME_TO_ID_MAP`):** A dictionary to map full reporter names (as might appear in input JSON) to their shorter, unique IDs.
*   **Helper Functions:**
    *   `get_reporter_from_name(filed_by: str)`: Retrieves a `Reporter` object based on a name string, using the map or `Reporter` class lookup.
    *   `calculate_publish_date(month: int, week: int, start_date: datetime)`: Calculates a target publication date.
    *   `cleanup_output_directory(output_subdir: Path)`: Removes temporary output directories if `CLEANUP_ARTIFACTS` is true.
*   **Main Workflow Functions:**
    *   `regenerate_artifacts(archive_id: str, steps_to_regenerate: List[str])`: Implements the logic for the `--regenerate` workflow.
    *   `publish_archived_article(archive_id: str)`: Implements the logic for the `--publish-archive` workflow.
    *   `set_article_status(archive_id: str, status: str)`: Implements the logic for the `--set-status` workflow.
    *   `process_story_from_file(story_data: Dict, story_file_path: Path, archiver: Archiver, skip_steps: List)`: Handles processing a single story from an input JSON file, calling `orchestrate_artifact_generation`.
    *   `orchestrate_artifact_generation(...)`: A central function that takes core content elements (reporter, title, article text, summary, etc.) and drives the generation of all associated media, formatting, exporting, and publishing. It's used by multiple workflows.
    *   `run_generative_workflow(reporter_id_arg: str, topic_arg: str, skip_steps: List, archiver: Archiver)`: Implements the logic for the `--auto-generate` workflow, from reporter/topic selection through AI generation steps to calling `orchestrate_artifact_generation`.
*   **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block:**
    *   This is the main execution block when the script is run directly.
    *   **Argument Parsing:** Uses `argparse` to define and parse command-line arguments.
    *   **Argument Validation:** Checks for incompatible argument combinations.
    *   **Archiver Initialization:** Initializes the `Archiver` instance.
    *   **Workflow Dispatching:** Based on the parsed arguments, it calls the appropriate workflow function (e.g., `regenerate_artifacts`, Denizen workflow logic, `run_generative_workflow`, `publish_archived_article`, `set_article_status`, or processing input files).

## 8. Key Utility Modules (`utils/`)

`app.py` delegates specific tasks to modules in the `utils/` directory:

*   `reporter.py`: Manages reporter personalities, loading their data from `prompts/personality_prompts.json` and individual prompt files.
*   `system_prompt.py`: Loads the main Ephergent universe system prompt from `prompts/ephergent_universe_prompt.md`.
*   `topic_generator.py`: Generates news topics using Gemini AI based on reporter profiles.
*   `article.py`: Generates article content using Gemini AI.
*   `summarize.py`: Generates article summaries using Gemini AI.
*   `title.py`: Generates article titles using Gemini AI.
*   `image_generator.py`: Generates prompts for images and interfaces with ComfyUI to create them.
*   `profile_image_generator.py`: Specific to Denizen generation; creates character details, backstories, and image prompts, then calls `image_generator` for image creation.
*   `audio_generator.py`: Converts text to speech using Kokoro TTS and can apply audio effects.
*   `video_generator.py`: Creates videos from images and audio using MoviePy.
*   `youtube_uploader.py`: Uploads videos to YouTube.
*   `pelican_exporter.py`: Formats content into Pelican-compatible Markdown and copies media to the Pelican content directory.
*   `git_publisher.py`: Commits and pushes changes to a Git repository.
*   `social_publisher.py`: Posts content to Bluesky and Farcaster/Warpcast.
*   `mailgun_sender.py`: Sends email notifications via Mailgun.
*   `archiver.py`: Manages archiving generated artifacts to persistent storage and interacts with the ChromaDB vector database.
*   `metadata_utils.py`: Extracts metadata from Pelican Markdown files.

## 9. Error Handling and Logging

*   **Error Handling:** The script uses `try...except` blocks around operations that might fail (e.g., API calls, file I/O). Errors are logged, and the script often attempts to continue with other tasks or stories if a non-critical part fails.
*   **Logging:** The `logging` module is configured at the start of `app.py`.
    *   Logs are written to `ephergent_content_creator.log` in the project root.
    *   Logs are also streamed to the console.
    *   Log messages include timestamps, logger name, log level, and the message.
    *   Different log levels (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`) indicate event severity. `DEBUG` level messages (not enabled by default in `app.py`'s basicConfig but used in utils) provide more granular detail.
    *   `exc_info=True` is used in some `logger.error()` calls within `except` blocks to include stack trace information for debugging.

## 10. Tips for Junior Developers Working with `app.py`

*   **Understand the Flow:** Start by tracing the execution flow for one of the main workflows (e.g., `--auto-generate` or processing an input file). Use the logs or a debugger.
*   **Focus on `orchestrate_artifact_generation`:** This function is central to content creation. Understanding how it calls different utilities and manages `artifact_paths` is key.
*   **Examine `skip_steps`:** The `skip_steps` logic (global via `.env` or per-run via `--skip`) demonstrates how different components can be toggled, highlighting the system's modularity.
*   **Data Passing:** Pay attention to how data (article content, titles, file paths, metadata dictionaries like `story_data`, `artifact_paths`) is generated and passed between functions and utility modules.
*   **Utility Modules:** When you want to understand a specific step (e.g., image generation), dive into the corresponding utility module (e.g., `utils/image_generator.py`). `app.py` primarily orchestrates; the "how-to" for each step is in the utils.
*   **Configuration is Key:** Many behaviors are controlled by environment variables in `.env` (see `env-example`) and configuration files (e.g., `prompts/personality_prompts.json`, ComfyUI workflow JSON). Ensure your `.env` file is correctly set up.
*   **Logging is Your Friend:** The log file (`ephergent_content_creator.log`) and console output are invaluable for troubleshooting. Check them frequently.
*   **Start Small:** Try running a simple workflow first, perhaps with many steps skipped (e.g., `python app.py --auto-generate --skip image,audio,video,youtube,export,git,archive,mail,social`), to see the basic text generation in action. Then, gradually enable more steps.
*   **External Services:** Remember that many parts of the system depend on external services (Gemini AI, ComfyUI, Kokoro TTS, etc.) being available and correctly configured. Check their logs if a particular step fails.
*   **Read the Utility Modules:** Each utility module often has its own `if __name__ == "__main__":` block for standalone testing, which can be very helpful for understanding and debugging individual components.

This detailed explanation should provide a solid foundation for understanding and working with `app.py` and the Ephergent CCS Auto system.
